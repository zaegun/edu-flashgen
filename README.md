# Flash Card Generator

This is a simple React website that is used to generate flash cards. The idea is that you can pick a subject and grade level then it can randomly generate flash cards to test your knowledge.

## Roadmap
Currently this only supports relational operators. 
Second phase is to allow the user to input an operator and have it check if it's correct or not.
Third phase is to start adding different subjects to choose from.

Additional Subjects
* 2nd grade addition problems (money based)
* 2nd grade subtraction problems (money based)
* 2nd grade spelling

## Purpose
This is for making flash cards and is not intended for teaching the subjects. 
Ideally, this generates the problem. solves the problem in writing, and uses the check functionality to make sure they got the right answer.
For learning to occur, their work would still need to be checked.
This is intended for personal use, but anyone is free to use it.
Initial efforts are for 2nd grade, 3rd grade, and Pre-K in that order.
