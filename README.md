# Flash Card Generator

This is a simple React website that is used to generate flash cards. The idea is that you can pick a subject and grade level then it can randomly generate flash cards to test your knowledge.

## Roadmap
Currently in the middle of second phase.
* First phase get base operator flash cards operational and check their answer.
* Second phase is to add different pages starting with basic addition and subtraction.
* Third phase is to add different grade levels for each subject to increase difficulty.

Additional Subjects
* 1st grade addition
* 1st grade subtration
* 2nd grade addition problems (money based)
* 2nd grade subtraction problems (money based)
* 2nd grade spelling

## Purpose
This is for making flash cards and is not intended for teaching the subjects. 

Ideally, this generates the problem. 
The user then solves the problem in writing or by speaking.
They can then use check functionality to make sure they got the right answer.
For learning to occur, their work would still need to be checked.

This is intended for personal use, but anyone is free to use it.
Initial efforts are for grades 1st, 2nd, and Pre-K.
